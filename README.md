## stack

This repository contains automated tests for a RESTfull api  
This is a basic and small framework just for challenge purposes. The same could be extended and improved as project requirements.  
I choose the mentioned stack since it's a simply and powerfull tech stack to start to build a robust automation framework.  
As application is written in nodeJS, this stack will integrate with development perfectly and in an easy way
